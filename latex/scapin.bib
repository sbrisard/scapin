  abstract = {For more than a decade, numerical methods for periodic elasticity, based on the fast Fourier transform, have been used successfully as alternatives to more conventional (fem, bem) numerical techniques for composites. These methods are based on the direct, point-wise, discretization of the Lippmann\textendash{}Schwinger equation, and a subsequent truncation of underlying Fourier series required for the use of the fast Fourier transform. The basic FFT scheme is very attractive, because of its simplicity of implementation and use. However, it cannot handle pores or rigid inclusions, for which a specific (and significantly more involved) treatment is required. In the present paper, we propose a new FFT-based scheme which is as simple as the basic scheme, while remaining valid for infinite contrasts. Since we adopted an energy principle as an alternative to the Lippmann\textendash{}Schwinger equation, our scheme is derived within a variational framework. As a by-product, it provides an energetically consistent rule for the homogenization of boundary voxels, a question which has been pending since the introduction of Fourier-based methods.},

  abstract = {We report on the mathematical analysis of two different, FFT-based, numerical schemes for the homogenization of composite media within the framework of linear elasticity: the basic scheme of Moulinec and Suquet (1994, 1998) [9,10], and the energy-based scheme of Brisard and Dormieux (2010) [13]. Casting these two schemes as Galerkin approximations of the same variational problem allows us to assert their well-posedness and convergence. More importantly, we extend in this work their domains of application, by relieving some stringent conditions on the reference material which were previously thought necessary. The origins of the flaws of each scheme are identified, and a third scheme is proposed, which seems to combine the strengths of the basic and energy-based schemes, while leaving out their weaknesses. Finally, a rule is proposed for handling heterogeneous pixels/voxels, a situation frequently met when images of real materials are used as input to these schemes.},

  abstract = {The local and overall responses of nonlinear composites are classically investigated by the Finite Element Method. We propose an alternate method based on Fourier series which avoids meshing and which makes direct use of microstructure images. It is based on the exact expression of the Green function of a linear elastic and homogeneous comparison material. First, the case of elastic nonhomogeneous constituents is considered and an iterative procedure is proposed to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation which naturally arises in the problem. Then, the method is extended to non-linear constituents by a step-by-step integration in time. The accuracy of the method is assessed by varying the spatial resolution of the microstructures. The flexibility of the method allows it to serve for a large variety of microstructures.},

  abstract = {Homogenization methods for periodic media rely on the solution of a local problem including periodicity conditions. The finite element solving of this problem is quite heavy-going in 3 dimensional settings. We propose to use a Fourier development of the solution, together with a simplifying assumption on the deformation of inclusions. A variational interpretation of this approximate method is given, which turns out to be a lower bound or an upper bound of the exact properties, depending on the stiffnesses of the individual phases. A comparison with finite element results demonstrates that this simplified method is reasonably accurate.},
