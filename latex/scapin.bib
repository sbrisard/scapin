  abstract = {Homogenization methods for periodic media rely on the solution of a local problem including periodicity conditions. The finite element solving of this problem is quite heavy-going in 3 dimensional settings. We propose to use a Fourier development of the solution, together with a simplifying assumption on the deformation of inclusions. A variational interpretation of this approximate method is given, which turns out to be a lower bound or an upper bound of the exact properties, depending on the stiffnesses of the individual phases. A comparison with finite element results demonstrates that this simplified method is reasonably accurate.},
